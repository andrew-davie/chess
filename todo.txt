on making a move of a piece...
    set "enPassantPawn" to 0
    When a pawn moves 2 on initial move, set "enPassantPawn" to the square of the pawn
    set MOVED flag to 1 for the piece

for pawn move
    if en-passant, then remove captured pawn from the board
    should this be jigged into the movelist?
